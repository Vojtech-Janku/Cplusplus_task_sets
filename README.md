# Cplusplus_task_sets
The finished tasks for a Programming in C++ course

There were 3 sets of tasks - s1, s2 and s3. 
In each folder there is a 00_intro.txt file which serves as a README for that set.
The codes for individual tasks are in the corresponding .cpp files
(some of the tasks are still unfinished / not yet attempted, these will generally have no compiled executable file)
